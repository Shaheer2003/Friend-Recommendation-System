# Friend-Recommendation-System
This project implements a friend recommendation system using the common neighbors metricâ€”a fundamental concept in graph theory. It analyzes a real-world Facebook ego network dataset to identify potential friend connections based on shared neighbors.

**Features**
-Graph construction using NetworkX
-Friend suggestion algorithm based on mutual connections
-Visualization of subgraphs using Matplotlib
-Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score

**Achieved:**
-Accuracy: 75%
-Precision: 75%
-Recall: 100%
-F1 Score: 86%

**Technologies Used**
-Python
-NetworkX
-Matplotlib
-scikit-learn

**Dataset**
